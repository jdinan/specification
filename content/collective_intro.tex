\emph{Collective routines} are defined as coordinated communication or synchronization
operations performed by a group of \acp{PE}.

\openshmem provides three types of collective routines:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Collective routines that operate on teams use a team handle parameter to determine
  which \acp{PE} will participate in the routine, and use resources encapsulated by the team object
  to perform operations. See Section~\ref{subsec:team} for details on team management.

\begin{DeprecateBlock}
\item Collective routines that operate on active sets use a set of parameters to determine
  which \acp{PE} will participate and what resources are used to perform operations.
\end{DeprecateBlock}

\item Collective routines that accept neither team nor active set
  parameters, which implicitly operate on the default team and, as
  required, the default context.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Team-based collectives}

The team-based collective routines are performed with respect to a valid
\openshmem team, which is specified by a team handle argument.
Team-based collective operations require all \acp{PE} in the team to call
the routine in order for the operation to complete. If an invalid team handle
or \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID} is passed to a team-based collective
routine, the behavior is undefined.

Team objects encapsulate the per \ac{PE} system resources required to complete
team-based collective routines.
All \openshmem teams-based collective calls are blocking routines which may use those
system resources. On completion of a team-based collective call, the \ac{PE} may
immediately call another collective on that same team without any other intervening
synchronization across the team.

While \openshmem routines provide thread support according to the
thread-support level provided at initialization (see
Section~\ref{subsec:thread_support}), team-based collective routines
may not be called simultaneously by multiple threads on a given team.

Collective operations are matched across a given team based on ordering. So for a given team,
collectives must occur in the same order across all PEs in a team.

The team-based collective routines defined in the \openshmem Specification are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_team\_sync}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_\{TYPE\_\}broadcast\{mem\}}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_\{TYPE\_\}collect\{mem\}}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_\{TYPE\_\}fcollect\{mem\}}
\item Reduction routines for the following operations: AND, OR, XOR, MAX, MIN, SUM, PROD
\item \FUNC{shmem\_\{TYPE\_\}alltoall\{mem\}}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_\{TYPE\_\}alltoalls\{mem\}}
\end{itemize}

In addition, all team creation functions are collective operations. In addition to the ordering
and thread safety requirements described here, there are additional synchronization requirements
on team creation operations. See Section~\ref{subsec:team} for more details.

\subsubsection*{Active-set-based collectives}

The active-set-based collective routines require all \acp{PE}
in the active set to simultaneously call the
routine.  A \ac{PE} that is not in the active set calling the collective
routine results in undefined behavior.

The active set is defined by the arguments \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride},
and \VAR{PE\_size}.  \VAR{PE\_start} specifies the starting \ac{PE} number and
is the lowest numbered \ac{PE} in the active set.  The stride between successive
\acp{PE} in the active set is $2^{logPE\_stride}$ and \VAR{logPE\_stride} must
be greater than or equal to zero.  \VAR{PE\_size} specifies the number of
\acp{PE} in the active set and must be greater than zero.  The active set must
satisfy the requirement that its last member corresponds to a valid \ac{PE}
number, that is
$0 \le PE\_start + (PE\_size - 1) * 2^{logPE\_stride} < npes$.

All \acp{PE} participating in the active-set-based collective routine must provide the same
values for these arguments.  If any of these requirements are not met, the
behavior is undefined.

Another argument important to active-set-based collective routines is \VAR{pSync}, which is a
symmetric work array.  All \acp{PE} participating in an active-set-based collective must pass the
same \VAR{pSync} array.  On completion of such a collective call, the \VAR{pSync} is
restored to its original contents.  The user is permitted to reuse a \VAR{pSync}
array if all previous collective routines using the \VAR{pSync} array have been
completed by all participating \acp{PE}. One can use a synchronization
collective routine such as \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} to ensure completion of previous active-set-based collective
routines. The \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} and \FUNC{shmem\_sync} routines allow the same
\VAR{pSync} array to be used on consecutive calls as long as the \acp{PE}
in the active set do not change.

All collective routines defined in the Specification are blocking.  The
collective routines return on completion.  The active-set-based collective
routines defined in the \openshmem Specification are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_barrier}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_sync}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_broadcast\{32, 64\}}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_collect\{32, 64\}}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_fcollect\{32, 64\}}
\item Reduction routines for the following operations: AND, MAX, MIN, SUM, PROD, OR, XOR
\item \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall\{32, 64\}}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_alltoalls\{32, 64\}}
\end{itemize}

\end{DeprecateBlock}


\subsubsection*{Team-implicit collectives}

The \FUNC{shmem\_sync\_all} routine synchronizes all \acp{PE} in the
computation through the default team. This routine is equivalent to a
call to \FUNC{shmem\_team\_sync} on the default team.

The \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} routine synchronizes all \acp{PE} in
the default team and ensures completion of all local and remote memory
updates issued via the default context.  This routine is equivalent to
a call to \FUNC{shmem\_ctx\_quiet} on the default context followed by a
call to \FUNC{shmem\_team\_sync} on the default team.

\subsubsection*{Error codes returned from collectives}
\CorCpp routines that return an integer error code follow the convention that \CONST{0} indicates successful local completion of the operation. This is considered a best effort of the implementation to indicate that all required local operations have been performed correctly inside the routine and the internal \openshmem state on the calling \ac{PE} is consistent with the description of the routine and its arguments upon completion. Implementations may use an integer return value from a routine to define integer error codes specific to the implementation as long as those codes are not already explicitly defined for that routine by the \openshmem specification.

Collective operations involving many \acp{PE} may return values indicating success while other \acp{PE} are still executing the collective operation. Return values indicating success of a collective routine on one \ac{PE} do not indicate that all \acp{PE} involved in the collective operation will return from the routine successfully. In the case where successful local completion of a collective implies the success of some global operation, such as team creation resulting in a valid team on all involved \acp{PE}, the implementation should not return \CONST{0} from the routine if the implied or stated global guarantees of the routine are not met.
