    \ac{PE} numbers in the active set.  \VAR{logPE\_stride} must be of type integer.}

\apiargument{IN}{pSync}{
    A symmetric work array of size \CONST{SHMEM\_BARRIER\_SYNC\_SIZE}.
    In \CorCpp, \VAR{pSync} must be an array of elements of type \CTYPE{long}.
    Every element
    of this array must be initialized to \CONST{SHMEM\_SYNC\_VALUE} before any of
    the \acp{PE} in the active set enter \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} the first time.}

\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} is a collective synchronization routine over an
    active set. Control returns from \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} after all \acp{PE} in
    the active set (specified by \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and
    \VAR{PE\_size}) have called \FUNC{shmem\_barrier}.

    As with all \openshmem collective routines, each of these routines assumes that
    only \acp{PE} in the active set call the routine.  If a \ac{PE} not  in  the
    active set calls an \openshmem collective routine, the behavior is undefined.

    The values of arguments \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and \VAR{PE\_size}
    must be the same value on all \acp{PE} in the active set.  The same work array must be
    passed in \VAR{pSync} to all \acp{PE} in the active set.

    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} ensures that all previously issued stores and remote
    memory updates, including \acp{AMO} and \ac{RMA} operations, done by any of the
    \acp{PE} in the active set on the default context are complete before returning.

    The  same  \VAR{pSync} array may be reused on consecutive calls   to
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} if the same active set is used.

}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    As of \openshmem[1.5], \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} has been deprecated.
    No team-based barrier is provided by \openshmem, as a team may have any
    number of communication contexts associated with the team.
    Applications seeking such an idiom should call
    \FUNC{shmem\_ctx\_quiet} on the desired communication context,
    followed by a call to \FUNC{shmem\_team\_sync} on the desired
    team.

    If the \VAR{pSync} array is initialized at the run time, all
    \acp{PE} must be synchronized before the first call to \FUNC{shmem\_barrier}
    (e.g., by \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all}) to ensure the array has been initialized
    by all \acp{PE} before it is used.

    If  the active set does not change, \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} can  be called
    repeatedly with the same \VAR{pSync} array.  No additional synchronization
    beyond that implied by \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} itself is necessary in this case.

    The \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} routine can be used to
    portably ensure that memory access operations observe remote updates in the order
    enforced by initiator \acp{PE}.

    Calls to \FUNC{shmem\_ctx\_quiet} can be performed prior
    to calling the barrier routine to ensure completion of operations issued on
    additional contexts.
