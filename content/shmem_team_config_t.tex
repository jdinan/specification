\apidescription{
  A team configuration object is provided as an argument to
  \FUNC{shmem\_team\_split\_*} routines.
  It specifies the requested capabilities of the team to be
  created.

  The \VAR{num\_contexts} member specifies the total number of simultaneously
  existing contexts that the program requests to create from this team.
  These contexts may be created in any number of threads. Successful
  creation of a team configured with \VAR{num\_contexts} of $N$ means
  that the implementation will make a best effort to reserve enough
  resources to support $N$ contexts created from the team
  in existence at any given time. It is not a guarantee that $N$
  calls to \FUNC{shmem\_team\_create\_ctx} will succeed.
  See Section~\ref{sec:ctx} for more on communication contexts and
  Section~\ref{subsec:shmem_team_create_ctx} for team-based context creation.

  When passing a configuration structure to a team creation routine, the mask parameter
  specifies which fields the application requests to associate with the new team.
  Any configuration parameter value that is not indicated in the mask will be
  ignored, and the default value will be used instead.
  Therefore, a program must set only the fields for which it does not want the default value.

  A configuration mask is created through a bitwise OR operation of the
  following library constants.
  A configuration mask value of \CONST{0} indicates that the team
  should be created with the default values for all configuration
  parameters.

  \apitablerow{\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_NUM\_CONTEXTS}}{
    The team should be created using the value of the
    \VAR{num\_contexts} member of the configuration parameter
    \VAR{config} as a requirement.
  }

  The default values for configuration parameters are:

  \apitablerow{\VAR{num\_contexts} = \CONST{0}}{
    By default, no contexts can be created on a new team
  }
}
