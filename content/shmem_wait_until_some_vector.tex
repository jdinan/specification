\apidescription{
    The \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until\_some\_vector} routine waits until
    at least one entry in the wait set specified by \VAR{ivars} and
    \VAR{status} satisfies the wait condition at the calling \ac{PE}.
    The \VAR{ivars} objects at the calling \ac{PE} may be updated by an
    \ac{AMO} performed by a thread located within the calling \ac{PE} or within
    another \ac{PE}.
    This routine compares each element of the \VAR{ivars} array in the
    wait set with each respective value in \VAR{cmp\_values} according to the
    comparison operator \VAR{cmp} at the calling \ac{PE}.  This routine tests
    all elements of \VAR{ivars} in the wait set at least once, and the order in
    which the elements are waited upon is unspecified.

    Upon return, the \VAR{indices} array contains the indices of at least one
    element in the wait set that satisfied the wait condition during the call
    to \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until\_some\_vector}.  The return value of
    \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until\_some\_vector} is equal to the total
    number of these satisfied elements.  For a given return value $N$, the
    first $N$ elements of the \VAR{indices} array contain those unique indices
    that satisfied the wait condition.  These first $N$ elements of
    \VAR{indices} may be unordered with respect to the corresponding indices of
    \VAR{ivars}.  The array pointed to by \VAR{indices} must be at least
    \VAR{nelems} long.  If an entry $i$ in \VAR{ivars} within the wait set
    satisfies the wait condition, a series of calls to
    \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until\_some\_vector} must eventually include
    $i$ in the \VAR{indices} array.

    The optional \VAR{status} is a mask array of length \VAR{nelems} where each
    element corresponds to the respective element in \VAR{ivars} and indicates
    whether the element is excluded from the wait set.  Elements of
    \VAR{status} set to 0 will be included in the wait set, and elements set to
    a nonzero value will be ignored.  If all elements in \VAR{status} are nonzero or
    \VAR{nelems} is 0, the wait set is empty and this routine returns 0.
    If \VAR{status} is a null pointer, it is ignored
    and all elements in \VAR{ivars} are included in the wait set.  The
    \VAR{ivars}, \VAR{indices}, and \VAR{status} arrays must not overlap in
    memory.

    Implementations must ensure that \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until\_some\_vector}
    does not return before the update of the memory indicated by \VAR{ivars} is
    fully complete.
}


\apireturnvalues{
    \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until\_some\_vector} returns the number of
    indices returned in the \VAR{indices} array. If the wait set is empty, this
    routine returns 0.
}
