\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_init} allocates and initializes resources used by the \openshmem
    library. It is a collective operation that all \acp{PE} must call before any
    other \openshmem routine may be called, except \FUNC{shmem\_query\_initialized}
    which checks the current initialized state of the library. In the
    \openshmem program which it initialized, each call to \FUNC{shmem\_init} must
    be matched with a corresponding call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize}.

    The \FUNC{shmem\_init} and \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread} initialization
    routines may be called multiple times within an \openshmem program. A
    corresponding call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} must be made for each call to
    an \openshmem initialization routine. The \openshmem library must not be
    finalized until after the last call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} and may be
    re-initialized with a subsequent call to an initialization routine.

\begin{DeprecateBlock}
\apinotes{
    As of \openshmem[1.2], the use of \FUNC{start\_pes} has been
    deprecated and calls to it should be replaced with calls to \FUNC{shmem\_init}.
    While support for \FUNC{start\_pes} is still required in \openshmem libraries,
    users are encouraged to use \FUNC{shmem\_init}. An important difference between
    \FUNC{shmem\_init} and \FUNC{start\_pes} is that every call to
    \FUNC{shmem\_init} within a program must be matched with a call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize}.
